## Rationale

### Project Introduction
An opportunity to test and enhance your classical music with this 2 level quiz. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced musician, this quiz is designed to challenge and help expand your classical music knowledge. The quiz has 40 questions spread over 2 levels of difficulty, easy or hard, the user will be given a random 5 questions, worth 10 points a question and 45 seconds to complete the quiz. The timer that has been added to encourage the user to think fast under time pressure.

### Motivation and Inspiration
Music is a part of everday life and has a significant impact on us all as humans. Classical music, in particular, is used for many aspects of media and advertising and whilst people may propose that they have little or no knowledge of the idiom, they are subjected to it frequently. This quiz provides the opportunity for the player to test their knoweledge at various levels.

The inspiration for creating this quiz is to produce a quiz that is accessible to all rather than just classical music fans, by doing so I hope to inspire those who have a limited knowledge of the genre to become more interested in it.

### Project Scope and Limitations

The scope of the project includes the creation of an online classical quiz with the features focusing on usability on mulitple devices and accessbility for anyone to be able to take part.

The known limitation is the quiz currently only has 40 questions spread over 2 levels of difficulty, easy or hard. So after playing the quiz a few time the visitor would start seeing some of the same questions. To solve this limitation I would expand the number of questions in both the easy and hard js files and potentially add a medium level of difficulty.

## User Experience (UX)

### Site Goals
* I want the userbto be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
* I want the site to be attractive, responsive and easy to use for the user.
* I want the site to work as intended incrementing the questions and score as the user progresses, with the timer going down for each question.
* I want the user to have a varied choice of questions.
* I want the site to be user friendly and for all ages.

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to be able to understand the rules.
* I want to be able to navigate the site easily to find information.
* I want to be able to find their social media pages.
* I want the game to be responsive to whichever device I am playing it on.
* I want to be under pressure and make the game timed.
* I want to be given a choice of varied questions.

#### Returning/Frequent Visitor Goals

* I want to be able to progress on to the hard level.
* I want to be given varied questions each time I play.
* I want to be able to easily follow them on social media pages.


## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Classical Music Quiz Website Colour Palette](docs/colourpalette.png)

The website uses a palette of black and white to depict sheet music. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

I have used Open Sans from Google Fonts for this website. It is a serif font.

![Open Sans](docs/font.png)

### Imagery

The background image has been been pick for it's classic look. I have credited this at the end.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

![Home Page Wireframe](docs/wireframes/home.png)
![Quiz Page Wireframe](docs/wireframes/quiz.png)
![Contact Page Wireframe](docs/wireframes/contact.png)
![End Page Wireframe](docs/wireframes/end.png)

## Features

The website is comprised of a home page, a quiz page, a contact page & an end page.

### General features on each page

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

![Favicon](docs/favicon.png)

* All Pages on the website have:

    ![Nav](docs/nav.png)

  * In the middle is the Title and tag line.

    ![Title](docs/title.png)

### Solved Bugs

1. The below error was occuring on the console. I tried to fix the bug and also googled how to resolve it, as I had already made MAX_QUESTIONS a Const. I ended up talking to my subsitute mentor Tim about the bug. The bug was happening because the if/else statement for the page parameters "level" is above the const variables, so it was calling startGame() which calls getNewQuestion() before the const vars are added. I was able to fix the bug by moving the if/else statement below the const stuff, so that let  and const are above everything else.
![Console error](docs/testing/consoleerror.png)
![Code before error was fixed](docs/testing/consoleerrorcode.png)

2. The below error was occuring on the console for both the index.html and end.html page but not for the quiz.html page. This occured because the timer was trying to. start with the index.html and end.html page. I ended up putting the timer and quiz in a seperate javaScript file called quiz.js which solved this bug.
