[Index Page HTML](docs/testing/w3cindex.png) - Passed

[Quiz Easy Level Page HTML](docs/testing/w3cquizeasy.pgn) - Passed



### Solved Bugs
1. The About Us section on the home page was not fitting properly when it was on a medium screen. So I changed the bootstrap grid system to large.
2. The images when on a medium device were overlapping with text. I fixed this by changing the bootstrap grid system from small to medium.
![Responsive Issue](docs/testing/responsiveissue.png) ![Resolved Issue](docs/testing/resolvedissue.png)
3. I had adjusted the Google Maps width to 100% to make the page responsive. The error was the % sign on the iframe code. I have reinserted a new link to Google Maps to clear the error and then put a paragraph aboud the iframe to be able to center the map allowing it to be more responsive. For the warning I just changed the section to a div.

### Known Bugs

On the Chrome developer tool, it comes up with 6 warnings and 24 verbose for the Google Maps link. The 6 warnings are regarding third party cookies will be blocked. The 28 verbose are for "Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive." When researching and looking on slack I was unable to find a solution without using JavaScript. As I don't have any experience so far with JavaScript this is currently unable to implement, but would be able to update it in the future.
